This course has given you a brief introduction to the tools that can help you read in, analyse and plot your data.

Once you're happy with the concepts in this course, you may want to look at the [Applied Data Analysis in Python](../applied_data_analysis/) course which starts to show how to apply more advanced techniques such as machine learning to data.
