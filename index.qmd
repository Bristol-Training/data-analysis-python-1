title: Introduction
jupyter: python3
---



This course is aimed at the Python developer who wants to learn how to do useful data analysis tasks.
It will focus primarily on the Python package [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) to query, combine and visualise your data as well as covering [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) to visualise them.

Data analysis is a huge topic and we couldn't possibly cover it all in one short course so the purpose of this workshop is to give you an introduction to some of the most useful tools and to demonstrate some common problems that surface.


### Intended learning outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- Know how to use Jupyter Notebooks.
- Be familiar with `pandas` and `seaborn`.
- Know how to read a data file and deal with format issues.
- Have the skills to create a simple plot to visualize and explore your data.
